<![CDATA[
The Djekian Crusaders is an original DND 5E podcast DMed and edited by Drega. The player characters are Swigahct the reserved half-orc paladin (played by Jee), Tynus Aderyn the naive aarakocra ranger (Bird), Noelle Hickey the motherly human cleric (Blue), and Vincent Paladino the scofflaw tabaxi gunslinger (Sand). These four heroes, drawn together by Fate herself, seek to circumvent the mysterious Vunthos' machinations in an epic quest that will take them to the edges of the known world and beyond. TDC boasts highly memorable NPCs, complex protagonists, a detailed and lively world, and the occasional goof. Episodes are roughly biweekly. Follow @TdcCast on Twitter for more info.

Half a lifetime ago, everything Swig knew came to an end. His fate's trajectory arced instead towards a veteran mentor, Vincent and Noelle, and a mission to save the world. Now, having found Yashu again in Sonderax, he'll have to make sense of his past and what it means for his future. Vincent tries glassmithing. Tynus goes where none have gone before.

Hot off her victory against Vunthos in Episode 33, Siren takes a couple of self-care days before her life gets complicated again. Someone's got to end the imperialist occupation of her hometown, and nobody's better suited for the job than Siren Volitaire. (And friends.)

After a couple of one-offs and an accidental hiatus, we return to the desert, where our crusaders are having trouble getting any meaningful intel out of some sneeple and flameskulls. We also just reference like, a bunch of memes. Swigahct dissociates (but it's not his fault this time). Vincent is blasting off again. Tynus finna SWOOP. Noelle gets scary.

<title>Episode 34: Holiday Special</title>
<description>
The kenku are saved, and everyone's feeling a mite celebratory! Grab a plate of tasty kenku cooking, have a seat by the bonfire, and relax as Jerndell and Fasmara sort of stare into space, lost in an extremely long sequence of flashbacks about their lives together. Jerndell creates a meat shortage. Fasmara experiences a Freedom Day miracle.

<title>Interlude: TDC Refugees</title>
<description>
Drega takes a moment to explain the homebrew travel rules he wrote up, to a very uncooperative group of players. The podcast will still use DnD 5E, but this system will govern traveling between points of interest. You can follow along and read the pamphlet here: http://tiny.cc/tdcrefugees BONUS: Jee’s loud, we force Blue to make a fursona, and Sand damages the very concept of thieves.
